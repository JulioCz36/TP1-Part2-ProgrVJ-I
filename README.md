## 📝 Objective

Create a small game where the player can move around the level, jump and hit blocks in the correct order before time runs out.

### Main mechanics:
- 10 blocks with random numbers (between 1 and 999)
- The player must hit the blocks **from lowest to highest number**
- If they hit the correct block: the number changes color
- If they make a mistake: 10 seconds are subtracted from the timer
- The game ends when all blocks are hit in order or time runs out

## ⏱️ End conditions

- Time reaches 0
- All blocks hit correctly

### Controls:
- **A / D**: move the character
- **Space / W**: jump
- **Shift + A / Shift + D**: run

At the end, all numbers are displayed in order, and you’ll see **Game Over** or **You Win**.
